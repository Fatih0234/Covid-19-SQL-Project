# Covid-19-SQL-Project
SQL code for Covid-19 datasets



My SQL queries in order to discover the Covid dataset I got from "Our World In data". 

In this project, I have the data which I downloaded on Our World In data website. I have tried to discover this dataset and ask different questions.  

My Approach; I have asked a question that is interesting and can be answered by using the data. and then I implemented the query by using different techniques SQL offers us in order to solve the question.  

I would like to hear from you about my thought process for these questions and like how would you do the same question. Finally, which questions would you answer apart from mines.
